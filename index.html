<p>
    A croissant is a French pastry in a crescent shape made from a laminated yeast dough similar to puff pastry. 
    It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl, 
    but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. 
    The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet,
     in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.

  Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity.

The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century, 
when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated dough.
